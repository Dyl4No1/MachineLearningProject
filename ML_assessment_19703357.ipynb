    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used distance metrics is the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points in the Euclidean space (also known as $L_2$ norm) is defined as the length of the line segment between those two points. For example, if we have two points in 2D space (i.e. two samples consisting of two features), $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\{x_{0,0}, x_{0,1}\\}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\{x_{1,0}, x_{1,1}\\}$, we can calculate the distance as:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to calculate the difference between the first features of the two samples, the difference between the second features of the two samples, then square each of the differences, sum those squares, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when we are dealing with points in nD space (corresponding to samples with n features) of the form $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{0,i}, x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, the procedure is very similar. To calculade the Euclidean disatnce, you need to calculate the difference between the corresponding features of two samples, square each of the differences, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum:\n",

    "\n",
    "In each decision node of a decision tree, this classifier splits the dataset into two or more parts according to a value of a certain feature in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of M samples $\\mathbf{x} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\} \\forall i=1..M$ with n features each $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, we could decide to split the dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ (numerical) feature at value $v$. This would mean splitting the dataset into:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{<}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} < v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ smaller than $v$ and\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} \\geq v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ greater or equal than $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we could decide to split a dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature which is categorical. If the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature of a sample $\\mathbf{x}_i$ can hold values $\\{\\texttt{child}, \\texttt{teen}, \\texttt{adult}\\}$, the resulting subsets would be:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\texttt{child}}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} = \\texttt{child}\\}$, which contains all the samples with the feature $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ equal to $\\texttt{child}$, \n",

    "\n",
    "In each node of the decision tree, the dataset is split according to the attribute $j$ which results in **the highest information gain** after the split. For categorical features, there is only one possible split (each category becomes a subset). For numerical features, it is neccessary to check all the possible values of split. For example, if the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ in the dataset has appeared with the values of $\\{1, 1.5, 2.7, 3.2, 5\\}$, you need to calculate the information gain for splitting the dataset at $v=1.5$ (into $\\mathbf{x_{< 1.5}}$ and $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq 1.5}}$), $v=2.7$, $v=3.2$, $v=5$.\n",

    "#### YOUR ANSWERS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color='red'>In terms of Machine Learning evaluation, Accuracy depicts the rate of how often the model predicts correctly as opposed to not, Precision is the rate at which the model predicts in agreement of the proposal correctly against the incorrect votes. Recall is the rate at which correctly predicted values are compared to the total values that resulted in the true positive result. Cohen's Kappa evaluation metric is used to assess the correlation of agreement between two raters which can be displayed in a correlation matrix to gain better understanding of the models' predictions. \n",
    "In addition to these performance metrics, I would also employ the use of f-measure and ROC graphs to visualise accuracy based on true and false positive values. better understand how accurately decisions are made.\n",
    "Cohen's kappa is the better performance metric to report from this evaluation because it thrives above others when the datasets in question have a varying number of classes. This metric is often used in fields such as medical diagnostics because of the vast array of false positive and negative results. Kappa is especially useful when comparing the performance  of multiple classifiers as it can provide a standardised measure between the classifier agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "</font> \n",
    "2. <font color='red'>In comparison to one another, a decison tree will take up more memory in total because it stores all of the splits, nodes and leaves in its memory which will obviously increase in correlation with the scale of the datasets. Whereas a KNN classifier doesn't need to store an entire tree structure with all decision points; it only needs the training data and distance metrics in order to function. Alternatively, a KNN classifier will be quicker to decide on smaller datasets because the computational logic behind it is far less cumbersome; a decision tree must traverse all nodes before making a decision. however, a decision tree does best with large datasets and can handle more complex data relationships, including comparisons between numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "</font> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <font color='red'>Normalisation in the sense of training a classifier is of paramount importance when in search of fair results; this process ensures that the data has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 so that the classifier doesn't favour this data over other entries just because of its scale. for example, if 2 separate data entries separately have a scale of 0-1 and 0-100, it will favour the latter because of this. \n",
    "Ultimately, normalisation removes any bias the classifier may have in processing the data.\n",
    "if we were to normalise the data before training the classifier, we would have gotten more accurate results as the model would have less biased decision making, selecting best features more accurately. It provides a better comparison when comparing results with separate classifiers or on different datasets. It is important to note that normalised data doesn't affect the overall performance of a decision tree; although it will affect a KNN model as the features will have similar ranges making them easier to be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "</font> \n",
    "4. <font color='red'>With the 80% train 20% test approach, there is a prevalent possibility of underfitting as the training set is too big and the classifier might not well generalise new data; this will cause the classifier to process unseen data ineffectively in later classification. when the dataset is unbalanced an 80/20 split may be less effective due to class under representation, a more even split like 60/40 may be more appropriate for itself and high-dimensional data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this evaluation, a metric that i would use instead of the ones stated would be K-fold cross-validation because it allows for a more precise and effective evaluation of a models' performance, especially more so on unseen data. It tests the models data by splitting into subsets of k partitions and repeating the process on all partitions to find the average result of this metric and reducing the risk of overfitting the data.</font> "
